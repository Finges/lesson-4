# Lesson 4 - Due May 8, 2017

## Assignment

Remember Pauline? Well, she was very happy with your first website you made
for her (or are likely still making.. that assignment is not even due yet),
except she feels like it's not "modern enough."

Given that Pauline doesn't know anything about websites, you're a little
surprised to hear this from her, but she apparently reads some tech blogs
and now thinks the website should be built in React. She's willing to pay
you again and you've been meaning to learn how React on the front end works
anyway, so uh... cool? Same design? Maybe with some better functionality.

You didn't really know how to get started, so you picked up [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)
and have some bare bones to how we get a React project started.

### The actual assignment

The list and the detail page will be hooked up, but you'll need to do the `Add
to Order` button and the `Basket` page again.
